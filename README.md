Website for college record lable
We were given this project by the college record lable. He asked for something professinal but hip (his words) and I felt 
the clean and simple style was perfect. At the time I was very nre to coding and I just wanted the chance to go a little crazy
so that's why I added the parallax scrolling, mostly because I wanted to see if I could.
